<h2>Copyright and Terms of Publication</h2>

<p>Authors grant to Parergon an irrevocable, fee-free licence to publish their articles in printed form and in other
    media (including electronic) that are the subject of sub-licensing agreements between Parergon and third
    parties. Any royalties or revenues received under such sub-licensing agreements will be collected and retained by
    the publisher of Parergon, the Australian
    and New Zealand Association for Medieval and Early Modern Studies (Incorporated).</p>

<p>Authors retain copyright of their articles and may republish them anywhere provided that Parergon is acknowledged
    as the original place of publication, and that the work is not published again within the first twelve (12)
    months of
    the article’s initial publication in Parergon (with the exception of the Open Access Provisions below).</p>

<p>Authors are required to certify that their articles are entirely their own work, and that the material contained
    within them is new and has not, either wholly or substantially in part, been previously published elsewhere.</p>

<p>It is the author’s responsibility to obtain permission to quote material from other copyright sources and/or
    reproduce any images or illustrations. Authors also bear any costs pertaining to reproduction permissions and/or
    the purchase of acceptable print-quality digital versions. Any Permissions to Reproduce must cover the original
    print publication, as well as the subsequent electronic distribution of the work via various commercial online
    databases, and documentation must be provided to Parergon.</p>

<h2>Open Access</h2>

<p>Authors may make Pre-Print (“submitted version”) and Post-Print (“accepted manuscript”) versions of their article
    available on their personal Web site, in their institution’s on-line repository, or in an on-line non-profit
    disciplinary repository. No permission from Parergon is required for these uses, and no fees will be charged.
    Publication in Parergon must be acknowledged, with a complete citation (volume, issue number, year, and pages).
</p>

<p>Authors may also make a Publisher Version of their article (as copy-edited, formatted and published) available on
    their personal Web site, in their institution’s on-line repository, or in an on-line non-profit disciplinary
    repository. No permission from Parergon is required for these uses, and no fees will be charged. Publication
    in Parergon must be acknowledged, with a complete citation (volume, issue number, year, and pages). This
    provision does not extend to the Project Muse version of Parergon and other on-line commercial versions; the
right to reproduce these versions is controlled by the database vendors concerned.</p>
